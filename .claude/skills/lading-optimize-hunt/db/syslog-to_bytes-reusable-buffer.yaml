lessons: |
  Successful optimization following the pattern from PR #1692 (JSON) and PR #1694 (Splunk HEC).

  Changes made:
  1. Changed Member struct fields from String to &'static str for hostname and app_name
  2. Removed into_string() method that allocated a new String per iteration
  3. Introduced reusable Vec<u8> buffer (512 bytes capacity)
  4. Used write! macro to format directly into buffer instead of intermediate String

  Key findings:
  - Micro-benchmarks showed 28% average speedup (well above 5% threshold)
  - Macro-benchmarks showed 14.5% speedup and 49.3% reduction in allocations
  - Total memory allocated reduced by 35.8%
  - Pattern is highly effective: eliminate format! -> String allocations by:
    * Using static string references where possible
    * Reusing a buffer across iterations with .clear()
    * Writing directly to buffer with write! macro

  This pattern should be applied to other payload serializers that haven't been optimized yet:
  - apache_common.rs (already has some optimization but could improve Path formatting)
  - fluent.rs (uses Vec<Vec<u8>> pattern - could be optimized)
  - trace_agent formats (check if they use similar patterns)

  The optimization is safe because:
  - RNG sequence is preserved (same random choices)
  - Output format is identical (validated by property tests)
  - Determinism maintained (seed-based generation)

  Next targets to explore:
  1. fluent.rs - pre-serializes members into Vec<Vec<u8>>, could serialize on-demand
  2. apache_common.rs - Path Display does multiple write! calls per component
  3. Other formats that weren't part of recent optimization PRs
