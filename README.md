This project is a suite of tools used for data generation and load testing,
primarily of the [vector](https://github.com/timberio/vector/) project today but
maybe useful for you too.

Please see the READMEs of the sub-projects for more details:

* [`lading_common`](lading_common/README.md)
* [`file_gen`](file_gen/README.md)
* [`udp_blackhole`](udp_blackhole/README.md)
