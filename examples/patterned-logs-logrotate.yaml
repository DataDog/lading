# Example configuration for patterned log generation using logrotate file generator
#
# This configuration uses the logrotate generator which mimics how logrotate
# operates in production environments, providing more realistic file rotation
# behavior.
#
# Run with: lading --config-path examples/patterned-logs-logrotate.yaml
