# Example configuration for patterned log generation using traditional file generator
#
# This configuration generates realistic logs with common patterns including:
# - Repeated service names, hostnames, and user IDs
# - HTTP request patterns with realistic status code distributions
# - Trace IDs for correlation
# - JSON structured logging format
#
# Run with: lading --config-path examples/patterned-logs-traditional.yaml
