//! Module to signal phase changes in lading.
//!
//! Lading manages at least one sub-process, possibly two and must coordinate
//! various 'phases' of execution in addition to any error handling. This
//! component was designed as a shutdown mechanism, but is also used to signal
//! the end of warmup phase.
//!
//! The mechanism here has two components, a `Broadcaster` and a `Watcher`. The
//! `Broadcaster` is responsible for signaling the `Watcher` that a phase has been
//! achieved. This is a one-time event and if multiple phases are tracked
//! multiple signal mechanisms are required. The `Watcher` is responsible for
//! waiting for the signal to be sent.
//!
//! There is only one `Broadcaster` and potentially many `Watcher` instances.
